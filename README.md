## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Telegram bot is designed to automate the operations of a pizza restaurant, providing a convenient way to order and pay for goods with delivery or pickup options. The bot is built with a database and state machine, enabling it to efficiently interact with users and process orders.

The functionality of the bot includes:

Menu and Products: The bot displays the complete menu of the pizza restaurant, including all available products, their descriptions, prices, and photos. Users can browse the menu and select items for their order.

Order Placement: Users can create orders by choosing desired products from the menu. The bot provides an interactive interface for selecting product options such as pizza size, crust thickness, toppings, and more. Users can also specify additional requirements for their order, such as preferred delivery time or special instructions.

Payment: The bot offers various payment methods, including online payments through payment gateways or cash payment upon delivery or pickup. Users can choose their preferred payment method and complete the order.

Delivery and Pickup: Users can provide a delivery address or select the option for self-pickup. The bot confirms the order details and informs the user about the status of the delivery or readiness for pickup.

Notifications: The bot sends notifications to users regarding order confirmation, order status updates, and other important messages related to their orders.

Feedback and Support: Users can reach out to the bot for assistance, ask questions, or leave feedback. The bot provides information about the restaurant's contact details and helps resolve issues or answer user queries.
